Things done: 
- Console Logs External Credits 
- Console logs all classes taken 
- Recognize which web page it is on and call either External Credits or Classes Taken functions

Things to do: 
- Convert the console logs into JSON
- I don't thinkk External Credits is robust yet. I feel like it only gets class equivalents done before BU (in terms of APs and IB); I need to check how it appears for someone who transfers in and someone who does summer classes at community college and then transfers those credits to BU.
- Figure out how to send this information to backend (ask Dani or Phillip how they want it).
